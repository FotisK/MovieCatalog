MovieCatalog
========

## What is MovieCatalog?
It's a tool that fetches movie data from various sources (imdb,tmdb) in orded to generate a local media catalog. The resulting catalog is inside an `index.html` file. MovieCatalog does **not** download movies.

## How does MovieCatalog find which movies to download data for?
**MovieCatalog** is filesystem-based meaning that it scans a specific folder for files and folders (eg. .srt files, movies or .torrent files or simple.txt files) and caches information for the movies based on the filenames. The downloaded data are kept in a `cache` folder.
